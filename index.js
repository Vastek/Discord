  var fileName = file.substring(0, file.length - 3); // Removes last three characters from file name to get rid of the .js extension (which should™ be .js ^^) for propper file name.

  var fileContents = require(`./commands/${file}`); // Defines fileContents of the export of the command in question.
  client.commands.set(fileName, fileContents); // Adds the command name to the client.commands collection with a value of it's respective exports.

  delete require.cache[require.resolve(`./events/${file}`)]; // Removes the cache of the required file to make it easier to reload and not take of more memory than needed.
